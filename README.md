# ImageLevel

Just a simple example of a tool for generating tilemap levels from a bitmap image.



### Planned features

- Pack all the levels into a bigger Atlas Texture.
- Convert Texture2D to Sprite level format.
- Create ScriptableWizard/CustomEditor from this, to pre-generate levels within Editor Mode.
- Generate Tilemap (Unity 2D asset) from the generated G.O. array.
- Separate the Color2Prefab section to become more modular.
